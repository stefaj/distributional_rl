# Distributional Reinforcement Learning
Tensorflow implementation of distributional reinforcement learning.
Currently the C51 Q-Learning Distributional Algorithm based on the 
paper `A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement`[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887) by Belamere et al. 
is implemented in Tensorflow.
Might contain some bugs.

Distributional Q-Learning seems to be more sample efficient than regular Q-Learning.

## Planned Work

# Clean up code
# Implementation of Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients
# Implementation of D4G
